Class declaration vs class expression

Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted, which means 
    that you cannot use a class before it is declared. 

// Using a class expression to create a conditional class
    const Toy = allowExtras ? class {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name
            this.hasExtras = true
        }
    } : class {
        constructor(name) {
            this.name = name
            this.hasExtras = false
        }
    }
*/

// Toy class declaration
/**
 * Represents a toy with name, colour, and cost.
 * @class
 */
class Toy {
    //  class field declaration
    name       // A class field without default value defaults to undefined.
    colour
    cost

    /*
        The constructor method is a special method for creating and 
        initializing an object created with a class. There can only be one 
        special method with the name "constructor" in a class â€” a SyntaxError 
        is thrown if the class contains more than one occurrence of a 
        constructor method.

    /**
